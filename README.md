Incremental rebuild for browserify

Update any source file and re-bundle, and only changed files will be parsed,
so it will build super fast (even with big dependencies like React!).


## How is this different from [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify)?

browserify-incremental can detect changes which occured in between runs, which
means it can be used as part of build systems which are invoked on demand,
without requiring a long lived process. Whereas watchify is slow for the first
run upon each startup, browserify-incremental is fast every time after the very
first.


# example

Use `browserifyinc` with all the same arguments as `browserify`, with the added
`--cachefile` argument specifying where to put the cache file:

```
$ browserifyinc -r react -o output/bundle.js  -v
556200 bytes written to output/bundle.js (1.38 seconds)
$ browserifyinc -r react -o output/bundle.js  -v
556200 bytes written to output/bundle.js (0.13 seconds)
```

Now if you change some files and rebuild, only the changed files will be parsed
and the rest will reuse the previous build's cached output.

You can use `-v`/`--verbose` to get more verbose output to show which files have
changed and how long the bundling took:

```
$ browserifyinc test-module/ -v -o output/bundle.js
changed files:
/Users/jfriend/code/browserify-incremental/example/test-module/index.js
1000423 bytes written to output/bundle.js (0.18 seconds)
```

If you don't specify `--cachefile`, a `browserify-cache.json` file will be
created in the current working directory.

# usage

# CLI

```
browserifyinc --cachefile tmp/browserify-cache.json main.js > output.js
```

All the bundle options are the same as the browserify command except for `-v`
and `--cachefile`.

# API

``` js
var browserifyInc = require('browserify-incremental')
```

## var b = browserifyInc(opts)

Create a browserify bundle `b` from `opts`.

`b` is exactly like a browserify bundle except that it caches file contents and
calling `b.bundle()` extra times past the first time will be much faster
due to that caching.

By default, when used via API, browserify-incremental will only use in-memory
caching, however you can pass a `cacheFile` option which will use an on disk
cache instead (useful for build scripts which run once and exit).

You can also pass in a browserify instance of your own, and that will be used
instead of creating a new one, however when you create your browserify instance
you must include the following options:

```js
{cache: {}, packageCache: {}, fullPaths: true}
```

For convenience, these options are available as `browserifyInc.args`, so you can
use them like:

```js
var browserify = require('browserify')
var browserifyInc = require('browserify-incremental')

var b = browserify(Object.assign({}, browserifyInc.args, {
  // your custom opts
}))
browserifyInc(b, {cacheFile: './browserify-cache.json'})

b.bundle().pipe(process.stdout)
```

The `cacheFile` opt can be passed to either the browserify or browserify-incremental
constructor.

# events

## b.on('bytes', function (bytes) {})

When a bundle is generated, this event fires with the number of bytes written.

## b.on('time', function (time) {})

When a bundle is generated, this event fires with the time it took to create the
bundle in milliseconds.

## b.on('log', function (msg) {})

This event fires to with messages of the form:

```
X bytes written (Y seconds)
```

with the number of bytes in the bundle X and the time in seconds Y.

# install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
$ npm install -g browserify-incremental browserify
```

to get the browserifyinc command and:

```
$ npm install --save browserify-incremental browserify
```

to get just the library.
